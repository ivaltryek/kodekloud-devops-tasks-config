# Puppet SSH Key Copy

## Task Description ðŸ“”

The Puppet master and Puppet agent nodes have been set up by the Nautilus DevOps team to perform some testing. In Stratos DC all app servers have been configured as Puppet agent nodes. They want to setup a password less SSH connection between Puppet master and Puppet agent nodes and this task needs to be done using Puppet itself. Below are details about the task:

Create a Puppet programming file `apps.pp` under `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests` directory on the Puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. Define a class `ssh_node1` for agent node 1 i.e App Server 1, `ssh_node2` for agent node 2 i.e App Server 2, `ssh_node3` for agent node3 i.e App Server 3. You will need to `generate` a `new` ssh key for `thor` user on Jump Server, that `needs` to be `added` on all App Servers.

Configure a password less SSH connection from puppet master i.e jump host to all App Servers. However, please `make sure` the key is added to the `authorized_keys` file of each app's sudo user (i.e tony for App Server 1).

Notes: :- Before clicking on the Check button please make sure to verify puppet server and puppet agent services are up and running on the respective servers, also please make sure to run puppet agent test to apply/test the changes manually first.

:- Please note that once lab is loaded, the puppet server service should start automatically on puppet master server, however it can take upto 2-3 minutes to start.

## Solution

- Generate SSH Keys on Jump Server (Thor)
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```

- create puppet file
  ```ruby
  $public_key = 'AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDVwhOwZXiPOEUjQlFCr87KNvhn8XSukn3nT9Ot8+7F38ibFmjCR7YZJ3SphnGMHAVTnLsDRViBJwVXOxWspqQ5NuOt5OZouRbQWbZze7uMoe0D+WF6qpZ8DgmXRA0U6u+5LHqen76EnGOl4zjFyxL35wE6ngwhcR0oq5aM/G+v54kgg8CxLQFQD1zlVw574vOv26W49vTWJGWkwkz1deDUJFIrrBsx/U+zj9kE0Pq8g6HtI+nfyGsqJzGcWqylMcQzWYoywmPXL27JtiVWPm5LK+l1DhrZYj0r9oYGmgPLA55TV760ZUC9nNKSFKKYZDDopQjRmCriA8ewl0eJjeUl'


    class ssh_node1 {

    ssh_authorized_key { 'tony@stapp01':
        ensure => present,
        user   => 'tony',
        type   => 'ssh-rsa',
        key    => $public_key,
    }
    }

    class ssh_node2 {

    ssh_authorized_key { 'steve@stapp02':
        ensure => present,
        user   => 'steve',
        type   => 'ssh-rsa',
        key    => $public_key,
    }
    }

    class ssh_node3 {

    ssh_authorized_key { 'banner@stapp03':
        ensure => present,
        user   => 'banner',
        type   => 'ssh-rsa',
        key    => $public_key,
    }
    }

    node stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com {
        include ssh_node1
    }

    node stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com {
        include ssh_node2
    }

    node stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com {
    include ssh_node3
    }
  ```

- Validate the template
  ```bash
  puppet parser validate apps.pp
  ```

- SSH into all 3 servers as a root and run the below command
  ```bash
  puppet agent -tv
  ```

- SSH into all 3 servers again, but now it should not ask for the passwords. If it works, then finish the task.
