# Ansible Lineinfile Module

## Task Description ðŸ“”

The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple `httpd` web server on `all` app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.

We already have an inventory file under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on jump host. Write a playbook playbook.yml under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on jump host itself. Using the playbook perform below given tasks:

Install `httpd` web server on `all` app servers, and make sure its `service` is up and running.

Create a file `/var/www/html/index.html` with content:

`This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!`

Using `lineinfile` Ansible module add some more content in `/var/www/html/index.html` file. Below is the content:

`Welcome to Nautilus Group!`

Also make sure this new line is `added` at the `top` of the file.

The `/var/www/html/index.html` file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

The `/var/www/html/index.html` file's permissions should be 0744 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.


## Solution

- go to the ansible directory by `cd ansible`
  
- create `playbook.yml`
  
  ```yaml
  - name: Install httpd and setup index.html
  hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      package:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    - name: Start service httpd, if not started
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
    - name: Add content in index.html. Create file if it does not exist and set file attributes
      copy:
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        content: This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!
        mode: "0744"
        owner: apache
        group: apache
    - name: Update content in index.html
      lineinfile:
        path: /var/www/html/index.html
        insertbefore: BOF
        line: Welcome to Nautilus Group!
    ```

- Run the playbook
  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
  ```

- Verify the changes
  
  ```bash
  ansible all -a "cat /var/www/html/index.html" -i inventory
  curl http://stapp01
  curl http://stapp02
  curl http://stapp03
  ```
