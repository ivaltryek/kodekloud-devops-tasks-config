 # Countdown job in Kubernetes

## Task Description ðŸ“”

The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to create few jobs in Kubernetes cluster. They might come up with some real scripts/commands to use, but for now they are preparing the templates and testing the jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:

Create a job `countdown-nautilus`.

The spec template should be named as `countdown-nautilus` (under metadata), and the container should be named as container-`countdown-nautilus`

Use image ubuntu with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e `ubuntu:latest`, and restart policy should be Never.

Use command for i in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one ; do echo $i ; done

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Solution

- Create job.yaml
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: batch/v1
  kind: Job
  metadata:
    name: countdown-nautilus
  spec:
    template:
      metadata:
        name: countdown-nautilus
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: container-countdown-nautilus
            image: ubuntu:latest
            command:
              - "/bin/bash"
              - "-c"
              - "for i in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one ; do echo $i ; done"
        restartPolicy: Never
  ```

- Apply the file
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f job.yaml
  ```
