# Print Environment Variables

## Task Description ðŸ“”
The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

Create a pod named `print-envars-greeting`.

Configure spec as, the container name should be `print-env-container` and use `bash` image.

Create three environment variables:

a. `GREETING` and its value should be `Welcome to`

b. `COMPANY` and its value should be `DevOps`

c. `GROUP` and its value should be `Datacenter`

Use command to echo ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"] message.

You can check the output using <kubctl logs -f [ pod-name ]> command.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Solution

- Create pod.yaml
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: print-envars-greeting
    labels:
      name: print-envars-greeting
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: print-env-container
        image: bash
        env:
          - name: GREETING
            value: "Welcome to"
          - name: COMPANY	
            value: "DevOps"
          - name: GROUP
            value: "Datacenter"
        command: ["/bin/echo","$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"]
  ```

- Apply the file
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
  ```

- Although you may see the pod status as `CrashLoopBackOff`, but check the logs if they're as expected then complete the task.
