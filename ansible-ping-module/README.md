# Ansible Ping Module

## Task Description ðŸ“”
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in Stratos DC. Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through thor user on jump host.

b.Make appropriate changes on jump host so that user thor on jump host can `SSH` into `App Server 1` through its respective sudo user. (for example tony for app server 1).

c. There is an inventory file `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` on jump host. Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 1, make sure `ping` works.

## Solution
- Generate SSH Files
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```

- Copy ssh pub key on App server
  ```bash
  ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
  ```

- Run the ansible ping command
  ```bash
  cd ansible
  ansible stapp01 -m ping -i inventory -v
  ```

- You should be getting an output, something like this.
  ```bash
  stapp01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    }, 
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
  }
 ```
